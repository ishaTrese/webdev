# Threadful

This project was developed in collaboration of ishaTrese (Trisha Mae P. Silvio) and yn-gnzls (Ayen Carl M. Gonzales) as a pair programming assignment.

To run this project locally:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open with VS Code (or any code editor)
3. Use Live Server extension to run the project

Note: Live Server is needed because jQuery is included locally, not via CDN
